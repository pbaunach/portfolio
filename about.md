    <p>
      I am a seasoned Product Design Leader with 20+ years of experience bridging the gap between high-level strategy and technical execution. Expert in building scalable design systems, coding high-fidelity prototypes, and leading cross-functional teams from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 enterprises. A "builder" at heart who leverages AI, modern frameworks, and user-centered research to deliver impactful digital experiences.

      I've spent 20 years watching the web evolve from static pages to AI-driven experiences. My sweet spot is the 'scary' 0-to-1 phase, where the data is messy and the roadmap is unwritten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I'm architecting a new way for students to find their path at Orchard or helping Aspireship survive four pivots on the way to $1.5M in revenue, my philosophy is the same: use the best tools available—like AI-assisted prototyping—to learn fast, fail early, and build foundations that actually scale.
