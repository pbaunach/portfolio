## 1. The Crisis: The 5-Minute Plan

**The Context**  
Nationwide, the student-to-counselor ratio makes meaningful mentorship impossible. Most high schoolers get a few rushed minutes a year to "plan" the rest of their lives.

**The "Generic" Trap**  
Without guidance, students default to "safe," broad majors like Marketing or Business because they simply **don’t have the vocabulary** for the modern workforce. They’re picking labels, not pathways.

**The Goal**  
Build an AI "Counselor-in-Pocket" that:

- Knows every job and every path.  
- Can sit with each student for as long as it takes.  
- Translates raw data into conversations and decisions that feel human.

## 2. Phase 1: Knowledge Discovery (Breaking the Generalist Cycle)

**Conversational Context**  
Orchard doesn’t start with a search bar. It starts with a conversation about **lifestyle and fulfillment**:

- "How do you want your days to feel?"  
- "Do you like building, analyzing, persuading, or caring?"  

The experience is designed so that a "Business" student might discover they’re actually closer to a **Product Marketing Manager**, **Revenue Operations Analyst**, or **Supply Chain Architect**, roles they’ve never heard of but are a better fit for their interests.

**The Hook**  
We blended TikTok‑style **"day in the life" shorts** with deep‑dive data:

- Shorts capture attention and provide an emotional "this looks like me" connection.  
- Under the surface, Orchard pulls in hard data on salary, demand, geography, and paths to entry.  

The design bridges the gap between **"this looks cool"** and **"this is a viable, realistic career path for me."**

## 3. Phase 2: The Action Plan (Navigating the Paradox of Choice)

**Path Comparison**  
For every career, I architected a side‑by‑side comparison of:

- 4‑year degrees  
- Apprenticeships  
- Self‑paced bootcamps  

The UI makes tradeoffs visible across time, cost, risk, and upside so students can compare paths **on their own terms**, not just follow a default route.

**Dynamic Roadmaps**  
I designed a modular tracking system where students don’t just see a goal, they see a **checklist**:

- Milestones across learning, experience, and application prep.  
- Clear progress markers so momentum is visible and rewarding.  

When a student’s goal shifts, for example from "Product Manager" to "Product Designer", the AI recalibrates the roadmap in real time. The interface is flexible by design, so change is expected, not penalized.

## 4. The "0 to 1" Execution

**From Ambiguity to Architecture**  
The CEO’s brief was effectively: "What if every student had a personalized mentor that actually knew them?" My contribution was to:

- Translate that ambition into **information architecture**, interaction patterns, and content types.  
- Use Cursor.ai to move quickly from narrative flows to working prototypes that stakeholders could click through.  
- Apply Tailwind-inspired component thinking so patterns were reusable and scalable from day one.

**Design to Code Synergy**  
Rather than stopping at static mockups, I:

- Built production-ready layouts and components that encoded the logic of the comparison engine.  
- Defined how the UI should respond to changing inputs (different careers, paths, constraints).  
- Worked closely with engineering so that the **behavior in code matched the intent in design**, from conversational prompts to path comparisons and roadmap states.

The result is a platform where a previously "unscalable" conversation, thoughtful and student specific career guidance, can now happen at scale, with design and AI working together as the mentor.
