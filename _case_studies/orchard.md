## 1. Executive Summary — The Hook

**The Problem**  
Traditional career pathing tools are often static, overwhelming, and disconnected from the daily habits of students. They focus on job titles and salary tables, not on how young people actually make decisions or build momentum.

**The Vision**  
Orchard reimagines career discovery as a continuous, conversational experience. The goal: transform dense Department of Education data into an intuitive interface that uses small, repeatable "micro‑habits" to keep students engaged over time.

**The Outcome**  
I led the design of a high‑fidelity, functional platform architecture that now acts as the production "source of truth" for the team—spanning information architecture, interaction patterns, and content models for future features.

## 2. Strategic Architecture & Data Complexity

**The Challenge**  
The CEO and CTO wanted to leverage complex government datasets (career outcomes, programs, locations, costs) without overwhelming students. The raw inputs were tables, CSVs, and PDFs—far removed from the way students actually think about their futures.

**Design Approach**  
I framed the problem through a design‑thinking lens:

- **Understand the inputs**: Mapped DOE data structures to the real questions students ask: "What could my life look like?" "What paths are realistic for me?"  
- **Define interaction patterns**: Instead of forms and filters, we explored conversational prompts and content "moments" that could be consumed in 2–3 minutes.  
- **Architect the experience**: Designed a modular page architecture where data‑heavy content is surfaced through approachable components—cards, short videos, and simple visual indicators.

**Key Insight**  
Through research into micro‑habit‑based learning, we realized that **short, consistently repeated interactions** were more valuable than occasional deep dives. This insight directly informed features like:

- **"Shorts"**: Bite‑sized career concepts delivered as swipeable content.  
- **"Videos"**: Curated clips aligned to topics students already consume—bridging entertainment and learning.  

These elements turned the platform from a static reference tool into an everyday companion.

## 3. The "Messy Middle": Rapid Prototyping with AI

**Workflow Evolution**  
Instead of a linear handoff process (wireframes → high‑fidelity → tickets), I used Cursor and AI‑assisted tooling to move from concept to functional prototypes rapidly:

- Sketched flows and IA for the conversational experience and multimodal content layout.  
- Translated those ideas into production‑ready HTML/CSS and interaction patterns directly in code.  
- Iterated alongside the CTO in very short feedback loops, using live prototypes as the shared artifact.

**Design‑to‑Code Synergy**  
My role blurred traditional boundaries:

- Defined the UX and content models.  
- Delivered real, shippable front‑end structures (including layout, responsive behavior, and component states).  
- Used AI to accelerate boilerplate implementation while maintaining a strong design point of view.

**Technical Proof on GitHub Pages**  
For this portfolio, Orchard is more than screenshots—it includes **the same architecture and components** that guided the engineering team. Hosting on GitHub Pages lets me:

- Expose the information architecture and layout decisions directly in code.  
- Show how interaction patterns are structured, not just how they look.  

## 4. Interface Breakdown

**Conversational Discovery — “Orchie”**  
On the left side of the main experience, students interact with **Orchie**, an AI assistant designed to move beyond job titles and salaries:

- Asks about lifestyle preferences, learning styles, and long‑term aspirations.  
- Translates ambiguous goals ("I want to work with people and build things") into concrete exploration paths.  
- Surfaces relevant Shorts, videos, and topics without forcing students into rigid forms.

**Multimodal Content — Shorts & Videos**  
The central content rail focuses on how students already consume information:

- **Shorts**: Quick, scannable concepts that make complex ideas (like ROI of different paths) approachable.  
-, **Videos**: Longer‑form, high‑intent content for when students choose to go deeper.  

This dual‑track design respects attention spans while still enabling depth where it matters.

**Information Hierarchy — Career Topic Cards**  
To keep exploration grounded, the interface uses bold, high‑contrast topic cards (e.g., **Product**, **Small Business**, **Healthcare**):

- Provide a simple way to anchor otherwise abstract choices.  
- Act as entry points into richer, data‑backed journeys within each domain.  
- Visually balance the conversational and content‑driven elements on the page.

## 5. Impact & Future Roadmap

**Source of Truth for the Team**  
The high‑fidelity prototypes and interaction architecture now serve as the **shared source of truth** across stakeholders:

- Aligned CEO, CTO, and engineering around a concrete vision.  
- Reduced ambiguity in handoff by tying every screen to specific data structures and content types.  

**Micro‑Habit Implementation**  
I defined the initial feature set for micro‑habit‑driven engagement:

- Daily and weekly interaction patterns.  
- Lightweight completion signals to reinforce progress.  
- Space for future personalization based on student behavior and goals.

**What’s Next**  
From here, the roadmap includes:

- Deeper personalization using behavior data from conversational interactions.  
- Richer content taxonomies across additional domains beyond the initial three.  
- Experiments around nudges and streaks to sustain engagement across a school year.
