      <p><strong>My Role – Head of Product and Design</strong></p>
      <p>(Feb 2024 – Present)</p>
      <p>I was part of the core team that developed the Orchard concept, leading the design and product strategy from the first sketch through our spin-off into a standalone company.</p>

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Problem: The Mentorship Gap</h2>
      <p>High schoolers are expected to pick a life path before they're even allowed to rent a car. Meanwhile, career counselors are so outnumbered that most students only get a five-minute check-in once a year. The result? Kids default to "safe" or "generic" majors like Business or Marketing because they simply don't have a guiding voice to show them anything else.</p>

  <div class="major-section-inner">
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Initial Thesis: "If we build it, they will search"</h2>
      <p>We started with a classic assumption: students just needed a better database.</p>

      <h2>For Students</h2>
      <p>A video-first searchable library with gamified quizzes to "prove" they were learning.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>For Counselors</h2>
      <p>A complex dashboard so they could track usage and assign "homework" to students.</p>

      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Evaluating the Hypothesis: A Reality Check</h2>
      <p>We took our first iteration into user research expecting to validate our "database and dashboard" model. Instead, we found a stark divide between what we thought people needed and how they actually behaved, and the feedback was humbling.</p>
      <div class="case-study-callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The "Search Bar" Bias:</strong> Students didn't "explore" because they didn't know what to ask. They defaulted to the same three careers they'd seen on TV, leaving the rest of our database untouched.</li>
          <li><strong>Dashboard Fatigue:</strong> Counselors were already drowning in administrative tools. The last thing they wanted was another system to log into; they needed a way to make their rare 1-on-1 time more effective.</li>
          <li><strong>The Quiz Friction:</strong> We thought gamified quizzes would prove learning, but students saw them as "just more schoolwork" and disengaged immediately.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Signal in the Noise: The Power of Video</h2>
      <p>While the search bar was a ghost town, the video player was a lighthouse.</p>
      <div class="case-study-callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Attention as a Metric:</strong> We noticed that even if students ignored the text and the quizzes, they would engage with the career interviews.</li>
          <li><strong>Visual Authenticity:</strong> They weren't just looking for data; they were looking for a "vibe." Seeing a real person in their real work environment humanized the careers in a way a salary table never could.</li>
          <li><strong>The "Scroll" Instinct:</strong> Students would fast-forward through long-form videos to find specific moments of interest, signaling that they wanted high-density information delivered in short, punchy bursts.</li>

  <div class="major-section-inner">
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Pivot: Ditching the Dashboard</h2>
      <p>With the research in hand, it was time for a reset. We realized that to help students, we had to stop acting like a school system and start acting like a discovery platform.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Shifting from "Search" to "Discovery"</h2>
      <p>The biggest hurdle was the search bar: students didn't know what to ask, so they didn't ask anything.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Feed Model</h2>
      <p>We replaced the traditional database UI with a mobile-first, scrollable feed of short-form video clips.</p>
      <figure class="case-study-screenshot case-study-screenshot--phone">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/orchard-screens/careers-mobile-homepage.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Careers mobile homepage">
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Hook</h2>
      <p>We cut our long-form interviews into 30-second "teasers" that focused on the most interesting parts of a job, the "Day in the Life" moments.</p>
      <figure class="case-study-screenshot case-study-screenshot--phone">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/orchard-screens/careers-mobile-short.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Careers mobile short">
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Emergent Exploration</h2>
      <p>By mimicking the social media patterns students already used, we saw "accidental discovery" happen. A student might scroll for a "Business" clip but stop on a "Product Designer" video because the thumbnail grabbed them.</p>
      <figure class="case-study-screenshot case-study-screenshot--phone">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/orchard-screens/careers-mobile-video.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Careers mobile video">
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Empowering the Counselor</h2>
      <p>We accepted that a dashboard was just more "admin work" for people who didn't have time for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Portfolio Approach</h2>
      <p>Instead of a tracker, we designed a simple "Favorite Careers" profile for the student.</p>
      <figure class="case-study-screenshot">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/orchard-screens/career-favorite.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Career favorite">
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Conversation Starters</h2>
      <p>The goal shifted from "tracking students" to "equipping students." We wanted them to walk into that one yearly meeting with a list of five careers they actually cared about, giving the counselor a massive head start.</p>

<section id="unexpected-turbulence" class="major-section major-section--turbulence">
  <div class="major-section-inner">
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Unexpected Turbulence: The ChatGPT Shift</h2>
      <p>We had finally found our "signal." The short-form video feed was working, students were exploring, and we felt like we had a handle on the discovery problem. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, ChatGPT was released.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, the world was flooded with AI apps. Most of them felt like dense, academic text blocks that used a lot of verbose "AI lingo" to say very little. It was a technology looking for a problem, and for a moment, it felt like the quiet, human-centric "mentorship" vibe we were building was at risk of being drowned out by the noise.</p>
      <p>And this seemed like a perfect time to rebrand.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Checking the Compass</h2>
      <p>Instead of just "adding a chatbot" because it was the trend, we took a step back to review our original mission. We asked ourselves a hard question: In a world where everyone has an LLM in their pocket, is our problem statement still valid? The answer was a resounding yes.</p>
      <div class="case-study-callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Reality:</strong> The counselor-to-student ratio hadn't changed.</li>
          <li><strong>The Complexity:</strong> The job market was actually becoming more confusing because of AI.</li>
          <li><strong>The Opportunity:</strong> We realized that while generic AI was verbose and cold, a guided AI, fed by our specific career data and human-centric philosophy, could be the "Counselor-in-Pocket" we had been trying to build all along.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Embracing the Magic</h2>
      <p>We decided to dive in, but with a strict design rule: The AI has to serve the human story, not the other way around.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="major-section-inner">
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Contextual Mentorship</h2>
      <p>We saw an opportunity to use AI to bridge the gap between "I'm interested in this video" and "Here is exactly how I achieve this goal."</p>
      <figure class="case-study-screenshot">

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The North Star: A Living Mentor in Every Pocket</h2>
      <p>This phase is where 20 years of experience met the most modern tools available to turn a vision into a "source of truth" that actually works. We moved from a discovery platform to a <strong>Mentorship Engine</strong>, focusing on a four-stage journey that guides a student from initial curiosity to a concrete, trackable future.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Enter "Orchie"</h2>
      <p>We designed Orchie to be the "Digital Counselor" in the room: a conversational AI that doesn't just regurgitate data, but asks the right questions.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Conversational Context</h2>
      <p>Instead of a search bar, Orchie helps students articulate their interests, moving them past generic "Business" majors into specific, high-growth paths.</p>
      <figure class="case-study-screenshot">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/orchard-screens/orchard-orchie.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Orchard Orchie">
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Compare Engine</h2>
      <p>We architected a UI that allows students to weigh multiple paths side-by-side. Whether it's a 4-year degree, a trade apprenticeship, or a self-paced bootcamp, we give every option equal visual weight to ensure students make an informed, accessible choice.</p>

      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Dynamic Roadmap</h2>
      <p>We designed a living "Action Plan" that breaks down terrifying life goals into small, manageable milestones.</p>
      <figure class="case-study-screenshot">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/orchard-screens/orchard-action-plan.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Orchard action plan">
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Ability to Evolve</h2>
      <p>Because high schoolers change their minds, the roadmap is modular. If a student hits a milestone and realizes they want to pivot, Orchie recalibrates the plan in real-time, removing the "failure" stigma of changing paths.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>The Technical Edge: High-Fidelity as the "Source of Truth"</h2>
      <p>Because we were moving into uncharted territory with AI-led UX, static mockups weren't enough. I pivoted our entire workflow to AI-assisted high-fidelity prototyping.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Building in Cursor.ai</h2>
      <p>Using Cursor and Tailwind, I bypassed traditional handoffs and built functional components that served as the production-ready source of truth for our CEO and CTO.</p>
      <figure class="case-study-screenshot">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/orchard-screens/orchard-cursor.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Orchard in Cursor">
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>Testing Logic, Not Pixels</h2>
      <p>This allowed us to put a working version of Orchie in front of students and counselors immediately. We could see exactly where the conversational logic broke and fix it in the code, rather than just guessing in a design tool.</p>

      <h2>Impact &amp; Final Learnings</h2>
      <h3>The Outcome: Moving from Idea to Classroom</h3>
      <p>What started as a way to close the Mentorship Gap has grown into a tool that actually changes how students see their future. We've moved beyond the "is this cool?" phase and are now seeing Orchard used in actual classrooms to help kids turn "I don't know" into a clear, personalized roadmap.</p>
      <div class="case-study-callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Validation at Scale:</strong> We are now presenting at the state and district levels, with academic leaders putting Orchard on their formal agendas for discussion.</li>
          <li><strong>Classroom Momentum:</strong> The true "North Star" moment was seeing students in actual classrooms use Orchie to move past "I don't know" and into a state of "I have a plan I'm excited about."</li>
          <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> By using an AI-assisted, high-fidelity workflow, we successfully narrowed the gap between design and production, allowing us to iterate on complex logic in days rather than months.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h2>What I Learned (and Unlearned)</h2>
      <div class="case-study-callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The "Mentor" beats the "Manager":</strong> I learned that counselors don't need another management system; they need a student who walks in the door with a sense of purpose and a prepared action plan.</li>
          <li><strong>Getting Out of Your Own Way:</strong> Admitting that my original counselor dashboard was a barrier, not a bridge, was a huge turning point and got us focusing on the right problem.</li>
          <li><strong>AI is a UX Problem, Not Just a Tech Problem:</strong> LLMs are powerful, but without the right multimodal wrapper (like our short-form video feed) and a living roadmap, they are just another overwhelming text box.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility is a Competitive Advantage:</strong> By designing for a wide range of educational paths, including apprenticeships and trades, we built a more resilient product that resonates with a far larger demographic of students and state leaders.</li>
