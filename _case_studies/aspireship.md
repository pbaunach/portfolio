## The Case Study Outline: From Learning to Livelihood

**The Thesis: Skills are Universal, Lingo is Not**  
**The Insight:** A VP of Sales in Hospitality is still a VP of Sales. They just need the SaaS "dictionary" and a way to prove their aptitude to tech recruiters.

**The Mission:** Design a low-friction pathway for mid-to-senior level transitions into the tech world.

## Phase 1: The Foundation (LMS Design)

**Behavioral Hooks**  
Designing the "SaaS Sales Foundations" course with high-engagement milestones and progress tracking to ensure students didn't just sign up, but finished.

**Expanding the Suite**  
Evolving the UI to support multiple verticals like Customer Success, RevOps, and Talent Acquisition as the product found its footing.

## Phase 2: The Pivot to Placement (The Portal)

**The Friction Point**  
Students were certified but still hitting walls with traditional recruiters who couldn't "see" their transferable skills.

**The "E-Harmony" Solution**  
I architected a proprietary matching portal. Instead of a cold resume drop, we designed a double-blind interest loop:

- **Candidate Discovery:** We presented curated roles to candidates.

- **Mutual Match:** Only if the candidate was interested would we show their profile to the hiring manager.

- **Automated Intro:** A "match" automatically triggered the interview scheduling.

## The "0-to-1" Execution & Growth

**Figma to Revenue**  
Built and maintained the design system that allowed us to launch new "pivoted" features in two-week sprints.

**Business Impact**  
These design iterations were the backbone of our successful Seed round and the eventual $1.5M ARR milestone.
