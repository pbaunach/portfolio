    Hi! I'm <span>Peter Baunach</span>, as a Product Designer and tech enthusiast, I’ve spent the
    last two decades at the intersection of <span>“Can we build this?”</span> and
    <span>“Should we build this?”</span>. I focus on the 0-to-1 phase, taking raw ideas and complex
    data and turning them into products people actually enjoy using. I’m a big believer in
    design-led strategy, rapid AI-assisted prototyping, and the philosophy that being wrong is just
    a faster way to get it right.
