    Hi! I'm <strong>Peter Baunach</strong>. I'm a <strong>Product Designer</strong> and <strong>Strategist</strong> who has spent the last two decades at the intersection of <strong>technical feasibility</strong> and <strong>meaningful user value</strong>. I specialize in navigating deep ambiguity: taking raw ideas and complex data and shaping them into products that feel effortless to use. I'm a big believer in design-led strategy, rapid AI-assisted prototyping, and the philosophy that being wrong is just a faster way to get it right. My work is built on the idea that the best products don't just solve problems; they provide the clarity and assurance people need to move forward.
